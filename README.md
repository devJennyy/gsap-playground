# A Journey into Web Animations

This repository showcases a collection of creative animations and experiments crafted with GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform), React, and CSS. It serves as a space for me to learn, explore, and push the boundaries of web animations.

As a React developer, Iâ€™ve found it challenging to work with GSAP animations in React, so this project is my attempt to master it. ``Please donâ€™t judge my experimental codeâ€”I'm still learning! ðŸ˜Š``  Feel free to use the animations here, and if you find this repository helpful, a like or even a donation would be greatly appreciated. Suggestions for animations are always welcomeâ€”I'll do my best to learn and implement them!

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

2. Add GSAP for React:

```bash
npm install @gsap/react
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
